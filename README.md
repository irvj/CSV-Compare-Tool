## CSV Compare Tool

A simple command-line CSV comparison tool written in Python that takes in two CSV files and compares the second file against the first to discover differences. The differences between the two files are written to a third CSV file, called output.csv.

The output.csv will show both a list of new/changed rows in the second CSV, as well as rows that are missing compared to the first CSV.
